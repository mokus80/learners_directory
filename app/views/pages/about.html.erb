<h2>Welcome to the Rails Learners Directory</h2>

<p>The Rails Learners Directory is a crowdsourced directory of resources to learn Ruby on Rails. It enables learners to find resources appropriate for them.</p>

<br>

<div><h4>Who is the Ruby on Rails Learners Directory for?</h4>
<p>The Learners Directory is for learners and coaches of all levels who are looking for user-recommended learning resources. It is also for resource-writers and aggregators to better spread their work.</p>

<br>

<h4>How is the Rails Learners Directory different from Google?</h4>
<p>Unlike a Google search, the Rails Learners Directory is a curated, organized set of user-recommended resources. Students and coaches alike can browse by cost, topic, skill-level, and much more. Our goal is that ratings and reviews help students and coaches find resources appropriate for them.</p>

<br>

<h4>Who maintains the Rails Learners Directory?</h4>
<p>The Rails Learners Directory was built by Nicole Fehlösi and Laura Wadden during the 2013 Rails Girls Summer of Code as part of Team Rails Grrls. Fehlösi and Wadden were coached by Duana Stanley, Deepak Jois, Oliver Hookins, Tobias Pfeiffer and Daniel Kehoe. The code is 100% open-source and available on github: http://www.github.com/mokus80/learners_directory. Please fork, add and improve as much as you like. To contact the owners, please message through github or tweet to @RailsGrrls.</p>
